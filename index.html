			<p>I’m the founder at <a href="http://makerbased.com" target="_blank">Maker Based Education</a> where we’re working to help schools bridge the gap between what students should be and are learning. I have a dream that one day every student will have the chance to learn skills (both hard and soft) that will equip them to be powerful in the real world.</p>

			<p>I’m also the Online Director at Miles 2 Give where we run across and around countries (10,000+ miles around the US this year) to help raise money for Sarcoma cancer research.</p>

			<p>You can find my short writings on twitter here. I write and contribute mainly at Maker Based Blog where you can learn skills to help you kick ass in today’s marketplace and of course plenty of learning hacks. Sometimes I write on Medium about whatever gets me excited, mainly educational reform and policy.</p>
